    "# From Peter Norvig's Q&A session on Quora:\n",
    "> I think that it will be important for machine learning experts and software engineers to come together to develop best practices for software development of machine learning systems. Currently we have a software testing regime where you define unit tests... We will need new testing processes that involve running experiments, analyzing the results... This is a great area for software engineers and machine learning people to work together to build something new and better."

    "Recently Peter Norvig was asked in a Q&A what he thinks about the place of software developers in machine learning research. And this is his answer. \"It's important for machine learning experts and software engineers to come together to develop best practices for the development of ML systems. We need new testing processes that involve running experiments and analyzing results\" and that \"this is a great area for software developers and ML expers to work together\". It is broadly in this spirit that I will be talking. I choose to make this talk more about engineering than about machine learning, since even minimal machine learning can go a long way with good engineering."

    "Last August, my company released a suite of apps, called the ReOs suite of apps, all of which have a very heavy data driven component. These are the three flagship apps of the campaign - reos message, reos music and reos camera. You can find all of them on the Google playstore. There are features in all these apps that use machine learning to drive a particular feature of the app. For example, the music app has features like automatic lyrics synchronization, identification of tunes from recordings, etc. The camera app has beautification / styling filters which are applied by a neural network. For the purpose of this talk, I will be focusing on the SMS app - simply because the machine learning built into it is easy to understand. Although, this will be representative of what most Android apps do when it comes to using machine learning."

    "I'll start with an example, and at the end of the talk I'll come back to how it evolved. So the SMS app is called ReosMessage - it classifies your messages into personal, transactional or notification messages and spam. So to build and deploy the classifier, all we had initially was a massive Python script - with a single input which was a CSV file. This file was just a dump of a table from a postgres database. We then would run some simple pandas functions to clean the data of unicode, emojis - anything else that was irrelevant. We didn't have any labels, so we used regular expressions to label a subset of the dataset into those three classes. On this data we trained some scikit-learn models. We used to send the model results to everyone in the office. They would all quickly glance over it let us know if they were any glaring classification errors. When we were somewhat satisfied with the results, the model coefficients were dumped into the JSON and were sent to the Android developers who could use them in their port of the classifier. It's easy to see how this could not have scaled. It's extremely monolithic, it's quite redundant in places, it wasn't modular at all, and also it was becoming increasingly difficult to debug. So I'll come back to this example at the end of the talk and I'll tell you what we did to fix these things."

    "So this here is a very broadly representative, a very general data processing pipeline. That box you see to the left is known as ETL part of the pipeline. ETL stands for extract, transform and load. You start with a source datastore, and end up in a sink datastore. The ETL part of the process is the most data-intensive one - by that I don't mean that others are not, it's just that this is the part where you treat your data for what it is - raw data. After it's left this box, it's no longer raw data, it's features, it's model coefficients, it's statistics, and so on. And it is in this box that your developer side has to be the most creative, as against your data scientist side, which has to show off outside the box. So after you've extracted, transformed and loaded your data, you train some model on it, and you do some validation which might allow you to do better model selection. Now, these steps - training, validation and model selection - are not necessarily well separated in time. You could be cross-validating one model while you are already training another model, and a third one could actually be in production that is writing the output to whatever your sink is. But the thing is that we tend to think about a pipeline as something sequential. You can't think if this as a pipeline. How do you bend the spoon? Think that there is no spoon. Think that there is no such pipeline, and each of these blocks are independent systems - these are microservices - which only happen to be loosely coupled."
