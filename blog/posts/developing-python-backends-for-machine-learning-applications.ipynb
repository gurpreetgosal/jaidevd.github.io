    "This is a follow-up to my talk at PyCon a few months ago. That talk was about continuous integration for data scientists. But this talk is going to be a lot more specific about its scientific computing aspects. I am going to be go into a reasonable amount of detail about the data processing and machine learning aspects of it."

    "Last August, my company released a suite of apps, called the ReOs suite of apps, all of which have a very heavy data driven component. These are the three flagship apps of the campaign - reos message, reos music and reos camera. You can find all of them on the Google playstore. There are features in all these apps that use machine learning to drive a particular feature of the app. For example, the music app has features like automatic lyrics synchronization, identification of tunes from recordings, etc. The camera app has beautification / styling filters which are applied by a neural network. For the purpose of this talk, I will be focusing on the SMS app - simply because the machine learning built into it is easy to understand. Although, this will be representative of what most Android apps do when it comes to using machine learning."
